NOTEBOOK INDEX

0 - Analytical/Toy CHE window
    01 - Analytical CHE window, MS winds
    02 - Analytical CHE window, WR winds
    03 - Toy CHE window, MS-WR transition, detailed dM, dA integrator
    04 - Toy WR wind model, very early demonstration that strong M-scaling
         leads to pileups, and that Zsun/10 favors ~35 Msun

1 - Early MS tests and results
    10 - First large grid of MS MESA models
         Did not filter for CHE systems, showing how non-CHE cases crash.
    11 - Closer look at cases of interest from NB10
         Well-behaved CHE stars, borderline CHE cases, crashes...
    12 - Second grid, updated WR winds (V17, S20,23) for NB11 cases
         General checks and comparison of analytical t_ES to MESA mixing timescale
    13 - Second grid, resolution tests (mesh_delta)
         At the time meant to try to evolve non-CHE cases (failed).

2 - Early He burning tests and results
    20 - Third grid, first grid up to He depletion.
         First look at internal structure (including succesful non-CHE runs)
         Aimless exploration, a few interesting plot on internal angular momentum, AM nu,
         He4, C12 and O16 profiles, as well as some of the first wind diagrams. Contains 
         our only somewhat stable non-CHE runs
    21 - Third grid, a look at resolution and (first) metallicity variations
         Still contains non-CHE models, stable or otherwise.
    22 - Fourth grid, through He burning. Starting from this grid, only CHE stars are evolved.
         HR tracks, internal structure. First m_initial - m_final relations, suggesting ~30 Msun BHs.
         First orbital widening estimates, showing chi_core > 1.
    23 - Fourth grid, first physics variations: Y0, deltaY.
         Finds that increasing Y0 increases m_final by a few Msun.
         Finds that increasing deltaY increases m_final by a few 0.1 Msun.
    24 - Fourth grid, InterpolatorV1 for Zsun/10, finding ~30 Msun to be somewhat favored.
    25 - Fourth grid, interpolates for Zsun/10 and Zsun/20, the latter shifts to ~45 Msun.
    26 - Fourth grid, compares analytical and MESA rot. mix. timescales. 
         Find analytical to consistently underestimate t_mix for borderline cases; underestimate
         t_mix by ~0.8 in the MS for the lower mass range and overestimate t_mix post-MS by at 
         least a factor 10.

3 - Cores at C depletion/Ne burning - tests and preliminary results
    30 - Fifth grid: largest grid so far, with Zsun/10, 720 models and <10 crashes.
         Winds: Vink (2001) + Vink (2017) + Sander & Vink (2020) + Sander et al. (2023)
         Applied janky InterpolatorV1 from NBs 24, 25
         First interpolation to find a peak at 35 Msun.
    31 - Fifth grid. CHE window from MESA. Identification of 35 Msun BH progenitors.
         InterpolatorV2, high resolution (1e8) interpolated sample.
         Again found ~35 Msun peak for Zsun/10.
    32 - Fifth grid. Variations on the fifth grid for higher metallicities, leading to many crashes.
         First check that CHE models were not hitting Pi.
